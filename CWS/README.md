CWS Updating Notes
================

# Update Extension Information via Dashboard

## Extension Description

Text will be saved automatically when no changes to it are made
within a timeout period in seconds.
Any change restarts the timeout operation.

Text will no longer be automatically saved when it shortens by
more than the given number of characters from its last autosave length.
Autosaving resumes when it grows within bounds again.

Text will only be automatically saved when it has at least the
given number of characters.

All editable and input text fields are autosaved, except for input
type password.
